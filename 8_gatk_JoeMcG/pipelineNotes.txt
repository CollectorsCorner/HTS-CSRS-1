	steps:
1	- samtools faidx <ref.fasta>
		Index reference sequence in the FASTA format
2	- picard CreateSequenceDictionary -
		Creates a sequence dictionary for a reference sequence
3	- samtools_sort
		Sort alignments by leftmost coordinates
4	- picard_MarkDuplicates REMOVE_DUPLICATES=F
		This tool locates and tags duplicate reads in a BAM or SAM file
			- REMOVE_DUPLICATES=F'alse'
5	- picard_AddOrReplaceReadGroups 'RGLB=lib1','RGPL=Illumina','RGPU=unit1','RGSM=20'
		Replace read groups in a BAM file.T
			- RGLB=lib1 -> Read Group library *Required.
			- RGPL=Illumina -> Read Group platform *Required.
			- RGPU=unit1 -> Read Group platform unit (eg. run barcode) *Required.
			- RGSM=20 -> Read Group sample name *Required.
6	- GenomeAnalysisTK_RealignerTargetCreator
		Determining (small) suspicious intervals which are likely in need of realignment 
			- nt 22 -> ??
7	- GenomeAnalysisTK_IndelRealigner
		Perform local realignment of reads around indels
8	- GenomeAnalysisTK HaplotypeCaller
		Call germline SNPs and indels via local re-assembly of haplotypes
			- L X -> Directs the GATK engine to restrict processing to specific genomic intervals
