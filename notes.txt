notes:

Ex2:
- Needs to be able to represent bool values. How do I do this properly?
	|- also, needs to offer a drop-down for yes/no

BCO Portal:

	- "creation_date" and "modification_date" and "type" fields need to be displayed AND type
	- Display "containers" in Json output
	

Q: For multiple db with complex types, dose the container or the fields have to have the multi flag?

Delete old "test objects" -> HOUSE CLEANING LIST

Enter will cause feild entry...
